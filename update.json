  	,"1.4.0":"Sort by Name fixed to sort by clientside translated display name, not internal item ID.  JEI sync setting (green/red button) is no longer a singleton-per-player-global setting, its saved independently for each remote and block so each can have a different value.  New config jeiMaximumRecipeTags to balance between JEI recipe auto-completion and Server Packet overflow errors.  Fix data tag recipes sometimes not working on servers.  Extra warning tooltip on Network exchange interface.  Fix Server Crash When using red Builder remote.  Update pt_br.json by  Mikeliro.  Fix Import/Export putting random blocks in the Upgrade slots.  Fix tooltip and tag search.  Fix NPE when connecting Network Exchange to certain blocks. Network Exchange interface capped at 5000 instead of 134217727 (greatly reduce lag).

This allows a new feature where the Crafting Remote can go into the ender chest or Curios slot and be opened by the key binding (i default). Patched some stackOverflow errors, please report if more come up.  Fix #254 Import Cables stuck on not importable items. "
  	,"1.5.3":"Fix  Curios and modifiers cause a crash #440 . "
  	,"1.5.4":"The Storage Request Table 'storagenetwork:request' block no longer saves the contents of its crafting-grid; instead items are returned to the player on close, exactly matching vanilla crafting table behavior  (this was changed to prevent potential exploits. If any items are left behind in the grid during world upgrade they will be returned and not lost. No changes were made to the remotes or to other blocks)   "
